BLQShopApp
=========

## development
I started with designing the models/interfaces for the repos, response, requests, used in the testvalley api consumption. After the testvalley api started responding, I designed components for the navbar, banner slider, shortcuts, and collections. I finished the design by adding responsiveness. 

## How to run the app

From the main directory, run (npm run dev) to start the server on your local host. The deployment link can be seen on https://blq-shopper-g9qu51sx8-je2781.vercel.app.
